# 3rdYearProjectWhatsApp
3rd-Year-Project
This is my 3rd year project for college. It incorporates material and topics from all the modules I studied in college. There was no specification provided as it was up to the student to choose the project.

Introduction

Since my first attempt at the messaging project was unsuccessful, the reason being…I could not get the WhatsApp API working, as everyone online was running into the same problem when I searched for a solution. So I had to change my app around slightly.

I set my goal to make a chatting app on visual studios 2015 using c#. First step I took was creating 3 projects in 1 containing a Client, Server and Interface using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application. 

Inside this project the client is going to be communicating with server and the server is going to be communicating with the clients, to create an instant messaging app. Also when a client goes offline other clients will pick up on this and see the client has gone offline at a certain time.

I done all of my projects design in Visual Studio “Blend”.


How to run the project

GitHub 

Project link: https://github.com/Jomzi/3rdYearProjectWhatsApp


1.	Import the project from github into visual studios.
2.	Run the project. 
3.	When the project is running a client window will pop up and also a the console server.
4.	Insert a username into the client.
5.	Run another client by right clicking the “ChattingClient” or press f5 (I think also works).
6.	Insert a different username into second client as a username that has already being used wont work!
7.	Once all this is done the app is very easy to use. (Screenshot below should help you)
